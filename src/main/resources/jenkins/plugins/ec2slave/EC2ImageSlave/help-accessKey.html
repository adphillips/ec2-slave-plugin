    Jenkins uses this access key ID and secret access key to interface with Amazon EC2.
    If you have already signed up on EC2, you can obtain this from
    <a href="http://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?action=access-key">here</a>.
    Otherwise, you need to sign up to Amazon Web Services to get one.
